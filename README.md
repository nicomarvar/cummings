# **Cummings**
Graphic version of May I Feel Said He by E.E. Cummings.  
[Check it out here! ](https://nicomarvar.github.io/cummings/).

For this project, I created my own graphics. Inspired by Derek Yaniger's work, the idea was to keep the playfulness of the poem as its tone builds up, as well as the background gradient does.

The code itself is simple and it was intended to be a practice of css positioning, transformation, filters and animation. The javascript code is my first attempt to create an intersection observer which led to learn a little about NodeLists.
